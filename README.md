# Kiwi

React project template which combines:

  * react
  * react-router-component
  * react-async
  * cortex (model layer)
  * express




Quickstart:

    % git clone https://github.com/shilpan/react-quickstart.git
    % npm install
    % node server.js

TODOs:

  * defer bundle loading (figure out why it doesn't work with the current configuration)
  * direct data access during server rendering (so we don't have to do XHR requests from server to get data)
